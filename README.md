Geckoboard Support Engineer Challenge

In this repository you'll find my twitter2.js file, which contains code that pulls data from Twitter and send it to Geckoboard. Unfortunately, I couldn't quite get it to work as planned. I kept having issues storing the response from Twitter in a variable that I could then send to Geckoboard. The code didn't seem to execute in the order I needed it to. I am not super comfortable with JavaScript, but I believe the issue lies in how JS hoists certain function and variable declarations. In order to complete the challenge, I would need to use a while loop to cycle through all pages of responses by pulling the next_cursor object from the response. Once the value of next_cursor = 0, there are no more pages of results. Upon completion of the while loop, I would send a count of the IDs to Geckoboard. In the code for sending data to Geckoboard, I hardcoded a number, but everything else seemed to work fine in that regard. In order to automate the process of updating the dashboard, I also looked into changing the chrontab settings, so that the program will execute even when not running. I also explored using the Task Manager for a Windows computer. Although I was unable to complete the task, this was my first crack at anything like this, and I think I came very close. With just a few changes, I believe everything would work as planned.
